Surveys can be run as anonymized or personalized surveys for specific members. Anonymized surveys can limited to TAN access only to run a representative survey.

Survey results are available as cumulated and detailed results with an option to export the results.

Exports will be in csv format. If the bundle [hschottm/contao-xls-export](https://packagist.org/packages/hschottm/contao-xls-export) is installed, exports will be in Excel xls format, if the bundle [phpoffice/phpspreadsheet](https://packagist.org/packages/phpoffice/phpspreadsheet) is installed, exports will be in Excel xlsx format.

A special thanks goes to Georg Rehfeld for his development of the detailed survey export and the enhancements of the survey tool.
