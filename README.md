# contao-survey
A contao bundle to create online surveys. Supports multiple choice questions, openended questions, matrix questions and constant sum questions. Surveys can be run as anonymized or personalized surveys for specific members. Anonymized surveys can limited to TAN access only to run a representative survey.

Survey results are available as cumulated and detailed results with an option to export the results.

Exports will be in csv format. If the bundle [hschottm/contao-xls-export](https://packagist.org/packages/hschottm/contao-xls-export) is installed, exports will be in Excel xls format, if the bundle [phpoffice/phpspreadsheet](https://packagist.org/packages/phpoffice/phpspreadsheet) is installed, exports will be in Excel xlsx format.

A special thanks goes to Georg Rehfeld for his development of the detailed survey export and the enhancements of the survey tool.
